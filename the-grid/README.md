# THE GRID
An experimental, browser-based simulation of a [mechanical destination board](https://www.google.de/search?q=destination+board&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi_8duF5crTAhWOJFAKHbDRDGIQsAQIJQ&biw=1280&bih=684) as known from Airports.

This WebApp is connected to the [New York Times API](https://developer.nytimes.com/): Each time a word is clicked, the display begins to print a random headline from the NYT-article-archive, containing that word. This allows an experimental, playful exploration of the contemporary history.
